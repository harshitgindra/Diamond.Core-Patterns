        <member name="P:Diamond.Core.WorkFlow.IWorkFlowItem.Ordinal">
            <summary>
            Specifies the order in which the specified step is executed in a given
            work flow.

        <member name="P:Diamond.Core.WorkFlow.IWorkFlowItem.Weight">
            <summary>
            Defines the weight applied to this step when showing progress. The default
            is 1 which makes it "evenly" weighted. A smaller value indicates this
            step should have less of an impact on the progress *takes less time to complete)
            while larger numbers have more of an impact (they take more time to complete).
            These numbers are totally arbitrary and are evaluated in relation to all
            other weights in the work flow.

        <member name="P:Diamond.Core.WorkFlow.IWorkFlowItem.AlwaysExecute">
            <summary>
            Indicates that regardless of the result of previous steps, this step
            should always execute. This is used in linear work flow managers that
            stop executing when one of the steps fail. A step marked with this
            attribute usually a "clean-up" step that must execute every time. This
             property may be ignored by certain work flow managers.

            <summary>
            Indicates whether or not a step should be executed during a work flow.
            his is used by conditional work flow managers where every step in the
            work flow is executed from start to finish unless tis property returns
            false. This property may be ignored by certain work flow managers.
